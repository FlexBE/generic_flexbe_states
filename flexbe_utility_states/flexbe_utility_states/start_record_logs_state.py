  A state that records the contents of the specified ROS topics in a bag file.
  Logging is done by creating a rosbag subprocess which is afterwards accessible using the output key rosbag_process.
  This state is typically combined with a StopRecordLogsState which gets the subprocess in order to stop logging.

  -- topics_to_record string[]  A list of topics (strings) that this state will log in a bagfile (.bag) using rosbag record.
                  They are usually specified in a config (.yaml) file, which is added as a behavior parameter.

  ># bagfile_name    string    Full path of the bagfile to be created by this logging.

  #> rosbag_process   subprocess  The process that is executing rosbag record.
                  The ID of this subprocess object can be used to kill it later.

  <= logging            Indicates that rosbag record was started.
