# Generic FlexBE States ![Build Status](https://github.com/flexbe/generic_flexbe_states/workflows/FlexBE%20CI/badge.svg)

A collection of robot-agnostic FlexBE states for navigation, manipulation,
perception, etc. They are agnostic in the sense that they only depend on
generic ROS packages, such as *MoveIt!*, and generic ROS topics.
