# Generic FlexBE States ![Build Status](https://github.com/flexbe/generic_flexbe_states/workflows/FlexBE%20CI/badge.svg?branch=ros2-devel)

A collection of robot-agnostic FlexBE states for navigation, manipulation,
perception, etc. They are agnostic in the sense that they only depend on
generic ROS packages, such as *MoveIt!*, and generic ROS topics.

> Note:  As of 19-June-23, some existing states are not relevant to ROS 2, and all only have minimal import testing
> to allow for initial ROS 2 release.  Verify behavior and submit PRs as needed
